# My Research Interests

Among all the courses that I have taken in collage so far, my personal favorites are Statistical Physics (ensembles, adding Boltzmann factors), Optics (adding amplitudes), Statistical Field Theory (almost everything in professor Kardar's book, especially the renormalization group), Quantum Field Theory (adding amplitudes, for beginners like me), Condensed Matter Field Theory (my favorite: the Anderson Higgs mechanism), and General Relativity.

You see that I'm really into adding things up and playing with fields, which is one of my research interests: field theory. I really want to know more about it. My second research interest is condensed matter theory, especially its connection to problems in theoretical physics. For example, the Anderson Higgs mechanism, or the gauge gravity duality.
