Hello, my friend! Welcome to Liqin Huang's blog.

This blog is named Liqin Huang's road to physics, and I will use it to note down the paces I take to the real physics in my mind.

I became genuinely interested in science when I was 10, after reading the magazine *World of Science*. Since then I bought it every month, and switched to *Scientific American* a few years later. When I was 12, I did my first experiment at home. It was about thermocouples, and I made a crude thermometer using two types of metal wires and a multimeter. It felt great.

When I was 14, I found chemistry very interesting. I liked the idea that the world is made out of only a hundred elements, which behave extremely different. There are also so many interesting chemical reactions, and some of them are taking place in our bodies.
