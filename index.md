Hello, my friend! Welcome to Liqin Huang's blog.

This blog is named Liqin Huang's road to physics, and I will use it to note down the paces I take to real physics in my mind.

I became genuinely interested in science when I was 10, after reading the magazine *World of Science*. Since then I bought it every month, and switched to *Scientific American* a few years later. When I was 12, I did my first experiment at home. It was about thermocouples, and I made a crude thermometer using two types of metal wires and a multimeter.

When I was 14, I found chemistry very interesting. I liked the idea that the world is made out of only a hundred elements, which behave extremely different. There are also so many interesting chemical reactions, and some of them are taking place in our bodies. I turned to physics a year later, however, since chemistry was just giving me more reactions while physics equations are simple and applicable to almost all scenarios.

Among all the courses that I have taken in collage so far, my personal favorites are Statistical Physics (ensembles, adding Boltzmann factors), Optics (adding amplitudes), Statistical Field Theory (almost everything in professor Kardar's book, especially the renormalization group), Quantum Field Theory (adding amplitudes, for beginners like me), Condensed Matter Field Theory (my favorite: the Anderson Higgs mechanism), and General Relativity. You see that I'm really into adding things up and playing with fields, which is one of my research interests: field theory. I really want to know more about it. My second research interest is condensed matter theory, especially its connection to problems in theoretical physics. For example, the Anderson Higgs mechanism, or the gauge gravity duality.
